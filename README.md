# ⚔️⚔️⚔️ Crusader Kings 3 Kid Picker! ⚔️⚔️⚔️

This is a companion app to the Crusader Kings 3 video game. It helps you pick which of your many heirs have the best stats. Calculations use weighted values that are highly configurable, these settings are found in the settings menu.

Using the purple form, you can add new kids or edit existing kids by choosing a name from the dropdown.

Kids can be sorted by age, score, or name.

## Developer notes

This was built for personal use, for fun! It's not optimized, it lags, likely has bugs, and certainly would not pass WCAG accessibility standards.

It was built with Create React App, TypeScript, and Material UI.

If you're reading this, I encourage you to pull/fork it and try it out!

CRA readme applies (the project has not been ejected) and follows:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
